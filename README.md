#### Geolocation Collection
Upon a shortened link being clicked, the user's IP address is collected and use to grab the general location of the user. From there, coordinates are organized and displayed onto the [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) component as a heatmap.

### Custom Link Aliases
From the dashboard, users will be able to create and customize new links, as well as viewing and/or modifying exisitng links. The link's "alias" is what replaces the random string of characters that identifies the Short URL. For example, rather than ```https://tinyclicks.co/d7Qw2eP```, a user could set the alias for their URL to be ```https://tinyclicks.co/CoOlLiNk```.
In the event of duplicate links, they will point to the same original URL/destination, but the link will be modified to avoid issues with collecting analytics for each link and user.

### Link Tree Hosting
Users can create a "portal" to host all of their links they want to share. Similar to websites such as linktree and linkinbio. Detailed analytics will also be available.
